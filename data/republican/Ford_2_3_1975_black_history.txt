IT IS most appropriate that Americans set aside a week to recognize the important contribution made to our nation's life and culture by our black citizens.

With the growth of the civil rights movement has come a healthy awareness on the part of all of us of achievements that have too long been obscured and unsung. Emphasis on these achievements in our schools and colleges and in daily community life places in timely perspective the benefits of working together as brothers and sisters regardless of race, religion or national origin for the general well-being of all our society.

In this spirit, I urge my fellow citizens to be mindful of the valuable message conveyed to us during the celebration of this week.
